AKTU CSE 2nd Year — Notes Website (Curated)
==========================================

Contents:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- /notes/<subject>/UnitX.pdf  (sample placeholder PDFs)
- /assets/logo.png
- README.txt (this file)

What I added (based on official AKTU syllabus):
- Data Structures (BCS301) units, Computer Organization & Architecture (BCS302), Discrete Structures & Theory of Logic (BCS303) units taken from the official AKTU syllabus PDF (see references).
- Maths-IV, Cyber Security and Universal Human Values units aligned and tweaked for clarity.
- Professional UI inspired by the site you provided but modified to not be a direct copy.

Enable contact form (actual email delivery):
1. Sign up at Formspree.io (free plan available): https://formspree.io
2. Create a new form and copy the Form endpoint ID (looks like https://formspree.io/f/xyzzxyz)
3. Open index.html and replace the form action URL https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID with your actual endpoint.
4. Optionally verify email in Formspree; test the form and you will receive messages in your email inbox.

Deploy on GitHub Pages:
1. Create (or use) a GitHub repo.
2. Upload all files at the repository root (index.html should be at root).
3. Enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → main branch → /root).
4. Your site will be available at https://<yourusername>.github.io/<repo-name>/

If you want, I can also:
- Replace the placeholder PDFs with real notes you upload.
- Host it on Netlify for you (needs your Netlify account) or guide you step-by-step to deploy and configure Formspree.
- Make the site's color palette, fonts, and spacing match any specific reference you prefer.
